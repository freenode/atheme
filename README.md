## freenode/atheme

This repository contains the source code for the services package running on the freenode IRC
network. It is based on Atheme 7.2.5, with various bugfixes and features backported to fulfil
freenode's requirements, as well as a few custom modifications.

If you are looking for an IRC services package, you probably want
[the upstream Atheme repository][upstream] instead.

## Contributing

We are generally welcoming to contributions. However, unless your change is specific to freenode,
we encourage you to consider contributing to [the upstream project][upstream] instead; that way,
networks other than freenode can benefit from your contributions as well.

In particular, if you are looking to report an issue, consider checking whether it is specific
to our modified version of Atheme to avoid reporting bugs in Atheme in two different places.
